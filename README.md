# Delphi Examples

  Examples of things I learned in Delphi.

1. Using a TRadioGroup

Many Radio Buttons can be used as a "select one of many button",
the actual best use of radio buttons, as shown in the Examples

1. Simple color pickers with TColorBox

This is a simple example of a color picker using TColorBox
This is simple, but since I used TColorBox.Color instead of TColorBox.Selected to get the selected color, it was difficult for me until I found the error

1. Quite complex selection check box with 2 check box, one selectable, other selected, moving from one to another.
Also a filter to help selection.

1. Grid with a combobox in the cells
